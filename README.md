This course is intended to teach the basics of using a compute cluster.  Although the material refers to the system architecture established at the MRC-LMB (in Cambridge, UK), the general concepts are applicable to a multiplicity of different setups. The course comprises 5 sections:

1.	[Introduction and setup](1_Introduction_and_setup.md)
2.	[Linux – using the Linux operating system and the command line](2_Linux.md)
3.	[Cluster computing – how to submit jobs to a compute cluster](4_Cluster_Computing.md)

The course slides (presentation.md), exercises and answers are also available here.  The slides are rendered using MARP (https://marp.app).

The individual sections of the course may be run separately, depending on the requirements of the course participants.
