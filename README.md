This course is intended to teach the basics of using a compute cluster.  Although the material refers to the system architecture established at the MRC-LMB (in Cambridge, UK), the general concepts are applicable to a multiplicity of different setups. The course comprises 5 sections:

1.	Introduction and setup
2.	Linux – using the Linux operating system and the command line
3.	Next-generation sequencing – a brief overview of NGS technologies and the associated file types.
4.	Cluster computing – how to submit jobs to a compute cluster
5.	Nextflow Bioinformatics Pipelines – running complex bioinformatics pipelines, such as those available from nf-core.

The course slides (presentation.md), exercises and answers are also available here.

The individual sections of the course may be run separately, depending on the requirements of the course participants.
