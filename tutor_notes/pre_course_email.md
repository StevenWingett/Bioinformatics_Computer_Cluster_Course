As you know, we run the Bioinformatics Computer Cluster Course **next week**.  It would be ideal if you could carry out the tasks described below before the end of this week.  This should take no more than 5 minutes to complete, but please do let me know if you experience any difficulties with this and I'll try and help.


**Obtain a cluster account**

You will need to be registered to gain access to the cluster, so please make sure you have an account.  To do this, please go to:
 
https://bb8.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/userdash
 
Log in with your LMB credentials, then click the "slurm" link in the "Additional" section and click the confirmation button.

Also, please **email unixadmin@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk and ask for "Bash to be your default cluster shell".**


**Software**

Please bring your own laptop to the course, which should be running a recent version of Windows or macOS.   Please install recent versions of the following software before attending the course:


Windows systems:

FileZilla Client - https://filezilla-project.org/

Putty: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

 
macOS:

FileZilla Client - https://filezilla-project.org/


Network Access

Please make sure you bring a machine that can **already connect to the LMB intranet via wi-fi (not the “Guest” network).**

If you can view the following page using wi-fi then you have access: https://bb8.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/userdash/slurm.cgi  (it should read something like: $ sacctmgr list user name=....... )


As I mentioned before, please try and complete this before the course begins, ideally by the end of this week.  Also, please contact me if you need further assistance, or indeed if you can no longer attend the course.

Many thanks.
